# Active Directory Home Lab – VirtualBox (Windows Server 2022 + Windows 11)

<img src="screenshots/overview-diagram.jpg" alt="Lab Architecture Overview" width="800"/>

A complete, isolated Active Directory environment built in **Oracle VirtualBox** to simulate enterprise identity management, user provisioning, policy enforcement, file sharing, and basic PKI.

**Purpose**: Hands-on practice for IT support/helpdesk → junior sysadmin roles.  
Demonstrates: virtualization, networking, AD DS, DNS/DHCP, PowerShell automation, GPOs, NTFS/share permissions, AD CS auto-enrollment.

## 🏗️ Lab Overview

- **Hypervisor**: Oracle VirtualBox (latest)
- **Domain Controller**: Windows Server 2022 Standard (Evaluation)  
  → Dual NIC: NAT (internet) + Host-only (internal lab network 192.168.56.0/24)
- **Client**: Windows 11 Enterprise (Evaluation) – domain joined
- **Domain**: homelab.int
- **Features**:
  - AD DS + integrated DNS
  - DHCP server on DC
  - Routing/NAT via RRAS (clients have internet)
  - PowerShell automated user/group creation & onboarding
  - Secure file share with group-based NTFS & share permissions
  - Basic Enterprise Root CA with certificate auto-enrollment via GPO

## 🚀 Quick Start / Key Achievements

1. Dual-NIC DC with internet sharing to internal network  
2. Fully functional AD domain with DHCP & DNS  
3. Scripted user creation & group assignment  
4. Departmental file share with least-privilege access  
5. GPO-driven certificate auto-enrollment (PKI basics)

## 🛠️ Technologies & Skills Demonstrated
